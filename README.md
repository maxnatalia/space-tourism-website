# Frontend Mentor - Space tourism website

This is my completed project for the [Frontend Mentor](https://frontendmentor.io) challenge. This project has been built following the provided design, logic and it is responsive to different screen sizes.

The task of this project was to recreate the logic, look and feel of the provided design from Frontend Mentor.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The challenge

The Challenge was to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible. Design project was made in **Figma**.

Users can be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
- See animation effects - **Framer Motion**

## Technologies

I used the following technologies during the project:

- HTML
- CSS (utilizing Flexbox)
- JS
- Styled Components
- Figma
- TypeScript
- React
- React Router
- Custom Hooks
- Tanstack Query
- Framer Motion

## Summary

This project was an excellent opportunity to apply practical knowledge of creating responsive user interfaces and implementing a design and logic based on specifications. Through this task, I had the chance to enhance my skills.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
